\usage{
stationsMF
}
\description{
A data frame with the following columns
\itemize{
     \item{\code{Id}, \code{Name} }{
        Identifier and name for the MF station.
     }
     \item{\code{Lat}, \code{Lon}, \code{Alt} }{
        Latitude, Longitude (decimal degrees) and Altitude
        (metres)
      }
      \item{\code{LongName} }{
         The long "exact" name in correct French. Mind spaces,
         accents and other special characters. Also compound names
         such can be a combination of two names, which is classical
         for airports.
      }
      \item{\code{Clim} }{

          A factor giving the climatic class, with the following
          codes.

          \itemize{
             \item{\code{"C"} }{\emph{Modified Oceanic}, mainly
                 for a Central zone located at the North of
                 Clermont-Ferrand.}
             \item{\code{"Med"} }{\emph{Mediterranean}. This covers
                 the whole French Mediterranean coastline up to the
                 South of Valence, including Toulouse.}
             \item{\code{"NW"} }{\emph{North-West Oceanic}, mainy
                 for North-West. This covers the Atlantic coastline
                 from les Sables d'Olonne (South) to Dunkerque (North)
                 and covers French Brittany, Normandy and Picardie.}
             \item{\code{"SW"} }{\emph{Aquitain Oceanic}, mainy for
                 South-West. This covers the Atlantic coasline from
                 les Sables d'Olonnes (North) to Hendaye (South).}
             \item{\code{"NE"} }{\emph{Semi-Continental}, mainy for
                 North-East.}
             \item{\code{"Mont"} }{\emph{Montaneaous}. The Massif
                 Central and the French Alpes, and the French part
                 of the Pyrenees.}
             \item{\code{""} }{Special: Tropical, Artic, ...} 
          }
      }

  The values given in \code{Clim} are derived from the Wikipedia
  page
  \url{https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climat_de_la_France}. Note
  however that the classification of stations is often done on the
  basis of \emph{yearly} variables, hence can not fully account
  for the variations that are seen at the daily level.
