\title{Phases of Sine Waves from the Trigonometric Coefficients}
\usage{
sinPhases(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A numeric vector having suitable names related to
the trigonometric basis \code{\link{tsDesign}}, or a numeric
matrix having suitable colnames. This object will most often
be given by applying the \code{coef} method for the
\code{"rq"} or the \code{"rqTList"} class, see
\bold{Examples}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \eqn{K} containing the phases
    \eqn{\phi_k} or a numeric matrix containing the phases as its
    rows. This vector/matrix has as its attribute
    \code{"amplitude"} another numeric vector/matrix with length
    \eqn{K} or with \eqn{K} rows, containing the amplitudes
    \eqn{\gamma_k}.
}
\description{
Find the phases \eqn{\phi_k} and the amplitudes \eqn{\gamma_k}
for \eqn{k = 1}, ..., \eqn{K} such that
\deqn{ 
 \alpha_ 0 + \sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_k \cos\{\omega_k t\} +
   \beta_k \sin\{\omega_k t \}
 = \text{Cst} + \sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_k \sin\{ \omega_k [t - \phi_k] \}
}
where \eqn{\omega_k = 2 \pi k /365.25} and where the coefficients
\eqn{\alpha_k} and \eqn{\beta_k} are given in the \code{object}
vector.
}
\section{Caution}{
 When a vector is given in \code{object}, it must
    be \emph{named} with suitable element names in order to allow a
    reliable extraction of the coefficients \eqn{\alpha_k} and
    \eqn{\beta_k}. These correspond to the names
    \itemize{
       \item{"cosj1", "cosj2", ... }{coefficients for the cosine terms
           \eqn{\alpha_1}, \eqn{\alpha_2}, ..., \eqn{\alpha_K}}
       \item{"sinj1", "sinj2", ... }{coefficients for the sine terms
           \eqn{\beta_1}, \eqn{\beta_2}, ..., \eqn{\beta_K}}
    }
    Some other named elements can be present e.g. for the constant
    or for trend terms: They will be ignored. Sim√πilarly when a
    numeric matrix of coefficients is given the colnames must be
    as before. The rownames will be re-used as rowanmes for the
    result.

\examples{
Rq <- rqTList(dailyMet = Rennes)
co <- coef(Rq)
sinPhases(co)
## for a vector
sinPhases(co[1 , ])
## change the order: the result is the same
sinPhases(co[1, sample(1:7, size = 7)])
